# TrainTimes

This project is designed to test our ability in applying firebase databases to our prior knowledge of javascript. This program allows the user to put a train into a database, determine an arrival time and interval, and then javascript utilizes this information to do math and return values onto the screen.

I went with a Harry Potter theme because when I think of trains, the first thing that comes to mind is the Hogwarts Express.

Add any train you like, and I look forward to seeing your submissions!
